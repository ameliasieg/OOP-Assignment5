Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming I (a.k.a. Object-Oriented Programming)- Programming Assignment 5

In this assignment, I combined dynamic memory allocation and operator overloading to make a container that behaves like a vector (in the mathematical sense) of arbitrary size. There is a class called DoubleContainer that has a dynamically allocated array of double values called "content". Functions are performed with the addition operator, subtraction operator, negation operator, and the multiplication operator.
